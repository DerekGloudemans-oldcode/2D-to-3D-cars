2D-to-3D-cars

This is a really cool and somewhat functional repository to convert your 2D bounding boxes into rough 3D bounding boxes (suitable for filter postprocessing into nice vehicle tracklets). It's super simple: just run trials.py, and you'll be asked to label a few lines that fall along the 3 principal axes for your video sequence. Then 3D bounding boxes are automatically extracted!
